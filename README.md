# Authentication Module for a website

This module ensures that users are not vulnerable to brute force attacks on weak passwords and helps them create better passwords. It makes the users follow the following rules while creating their passwords: 
1. Minimum length: 6
2. Maximum length: 12
3. At least 1 letter in [a-z], [0-9], [A-Z] and [*$_#=@] each.
4. It should not contain any letter from [%!)(]

In order to test the code, one has to enter a list of passwords separated by commas and wait for the output which consists of success or failure messages for valid and invalid passwords respectively.
